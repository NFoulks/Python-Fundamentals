# for loop example
# initialization, condition, and updation in one

# i initialized to first value in range list
# while i is in the range
# update i by range increment each loop
for i in range(1, 11): # range ... 1...10
    print(i)

# while loop equivalent
i = 1
while(i < 11):
    print(i)
    i += 1
