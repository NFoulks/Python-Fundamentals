    ASCII Art 2 - using literals and variables

    This program produces an ASCII art on the console.
    It should look something like this.

    Algorithm steps: 
    1. Use variables to store art and data
    2. Write a series of print statements to print the data/values to the console, using the .center() method
        to keep the strings centered.
